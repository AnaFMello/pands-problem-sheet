Week 1
1: Hello World
2: Project Description
- This project seems to be the first project for newbies into Programming World.
- This project simply outputs the phrase "Hello Word!"

Week 2
1: Bank.py
2: Project Description
- This program convert integer numbers into a decimal number. 
- So first I realized I need to create an input. So I difened the imput as float number.  
- Then I divided the float number per 100, trasforming it to cents, and in the sequence simply added the numbers.
- I tried to find other ways to convert the integer number into decimal, but this way had more sense for me at this moment, but I feel it can be done in another way. 
- The code finishing with the output "Your amount total is " + the value added before. 


Week 3
1: Accounts.py
2: Project Description
- This program read a account of any length and replace the characters with Xs, except the last four digits.
- The first part of the program the user give the input, which will following be divided in two parts. The first part will contain all number, except the last 4 digits. The second part will contain only the last for digits. To do it I used the slicing function in both cases. 
- After the input and slicing, I created a loop o make able that any length of input could be sliced and replaced with Xs.
- The ogic behind this program was on my mind all the time, but at the start I had no idea how to make it actually happen. I took me few hours to find this way, but I got it.

Week 4
1: Collatz.py
2: Project Description
- This task asks the user to input any positive integer
- At each step calculate the next value by taking the current value and, if it is even, divide it by two, 
- But if it is odd, multiply it by three and add one. 
- This program has input, loop and output. 
- This task was the easiest one on my opinion, as the loop was able to do the math. 
- If the input is divided by 2 and the result is zero, the program output the loop of all number divided and divided till zero. But is the number is odd, the loop added one and kept diving till it is zero.

Week 5
1: Weekday.py
2: Project Description
- This project tells which day of the week is. 
- IÂ´ve done this project in one of my classes with teacher Liam. The code import the data from datetime and print which day is today. The outout changes if is weekday or weekend.

Week 6
1: Project Title
2: Project Description
- What the program/application is going does
- Why you used certain codes (similar to the comments in the file - explain why you wrote it that way - shows you understand what code you used too)
- What was difficult and what you would like to add in the future.

Week 7

- What the program/application is going does
- Why you used certain codes (similar to the comments in the file - explain why you wrote it that way - shows you understand what code you used too)
- What was difficult and what you would like to add in the future.
3: Table of Contents (only if its very long code - eg: End of Semester Project)
4: How to Run or Install the code - we dont need this probably until later
5: How to use the code - Screenshots of the program running eg: picture of the code and what it results in
6: References - any links from what you found when googling for help with code or when looking to see how things are coded. - Even qualified programmers/data analysts google a lot, and were not being told how to do everything because they're trying to teach us how to research as well.
