- This program convert integer numbers into a decimal number. 
- So first I realized I need to create an input. So I difened the imput as float number.  
Why you used certain codes (similar to the comments in the file - explain why you wrote it that way - shows you understand what code you used too)
- What was difficult and what you would like to add in the future.
3: Table of Contents (only if its very long code - eg: End of Semester Project)
4: How to Run or Install the code - we dont need this probably until later
5: How to use the code - Screenshots of the program running eg: picture of the code and what it results in
6: References - any links from what you found when googling for help with code or when looking to see how things are coded. - Even qualified programmers/data analysts google a lot, and were not being told how to do everything because they're trying to teach us how to research as well.
